Lines becoming further defined, further seared.\n\nI learned of the separation of east and west with a color, green, named for the vegetation that grew in between.

A naïve relationship to experiences never lived.\n\nAs a child, I couldn’t account for your psychic space, of the specificities of the events you held.

A continual frustration in attempts at naming it.\n\nI see now we are both at least partially formed through violence. No postwar only pauses. No prewar, only moments of ignorance. Forever holding these events, the both of us, in differing ways.\n\nAnd here: a question of representation, a form unknown. No more images of war, something else. I asked for footage from friends and strangers. I asked for the sun, the sky, the sea. I asked for a voice, immediately familiar, borrowed but not my own. A collaboration of sorts. A stand-in. A shared narrative, still ongoing.\n\nThis is not an answer. Nor is it a precise reflection of experience. Rather it’s an attempt at grasping the elusive. A meditation on the after, a sitting in the ripples. As far as I can yet go."}]}}]},"slug":"14-untitled-the-wars-in-lebanon"},{"uuid":"df3c1f4a-ac48-4ac4-aab2-9485a53a11db","id":"08","title":"Untitled (Saturday, October 16, 1993)","tags":["video"],"year":"2015","thumbnail":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4c0abc75-9d33-4ece-829e-c21911703559/RamiGeorge_2015_Untitled-Saturday-October-16-1993_ref.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45/20220807/us-west-2/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220807T231757Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=8d1d96773e4e97c1f489de2b4f7c9abba64b419920eac9e4251a621a342a4f3c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject","medium":"HD video, color, sound\n5:00 min.","description":"Voice of Cassidy Slaughter-Mason","homePageAssets":{"uuid":"9d8b3388-5fc9-4299-9642-f04e5e35f5e5","type":"Video","files":[{"url":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/38daa767-5cfb-4252-8c4c-96c86a4a925a/RamiGeorge_2015_Untitled-Saturday-October-16-1993_00.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220807%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220807T231757Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=2e0daf53cb57a83e6b4eb4766ac51d68c86078d310bf6e1ac11400bb42bfea3c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject"}]},"transcript":{"uuid":"0785f690-6b28-4166-bb1d-5e6800454734","ProjectUUID":"OSQm","blocks":[{"object":"block","id":"224c585e-b7ea-4457-8e7c-bf48c031400a","type":"code","created_time":"2022-05-23T16:02:00Z","last_edited_time":"2022-05-23T16:03:00Z","created_by":{"object":"user","id":"b84e74af-1a0b-495e-ac45-7fa25f54d686","type":"","name":"","avatar_url":"","person":null,"bot":null},"last_edited_by":{"object":"user","id":"b84e74af-1a0b-495e-ac45-7fa25f54d686","type":"","name":"","avatar_url":"","person":null,"bot":null},"code":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"<div grid-col=\"9\" grid-pad=\"5\">\n<h2>[ the<br><br><i>Whenever you’re ready…</i><br>\n\n<br>\nA religious cult in Guthrie may have had connection with David Koresh and the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas, a Guthrie police official said Friday. The official, who asked not to be identified, said he received inquiries from federal agencies about a possible connection between the Samaritan Foundation, located in the old territorial jail at 214 W. Noble, and the Branch Davidians. He said the inquiries came before the spring standoff in Waco between federal agents and Koresh and his followers. The Samaritan Foundation's existence became public knowledge Thursday during an emergency child custody hearing in the courtroom of Logan County Associate District Judge Penny Howard.<br>\n\n<br>\nJonathan George, 42, of Sommerville, Massachusetts, was in Guthrie to regain custody of his two children, Leila Malini George, 7, and Rami Michael George, 4. The children's mother, Nelli George, 40, had brought them to Guthrie on September 2. The Beirut, Lebanon native told her husband she wanted to spend ten days in Guthrie at a seminar. He said she described it to him as \"the chance of a lifetime.\" Jonathan George said that once the children's mother arrived in Guthrie, he had difficulty reaching her or the children by phone and could only leave messages on an answering machine belonging to Linda Greene, head of the Samaritan Foundation.<br>\n\n<br>\nHe said he had spoken to the children a total of 12 minutes since they arrived in Guthrie. Nelli George testified she decided she did not want to go back to her husband and filed for separate maintenance. Jonathan George, a contractor who said he does the fine finish work for the television show This Old House, then sought help from Massachusetts state courts. A judge there granted him temporary custody of the children on October 5. He came to Oklahoma to get the children.<br>\n\n<br>\nHoward ruled Friday that the children were to return to Massachusetts with their father because the state had jurisdiction and because it is the children's home state. During the course of the hearing that began Thursday, the children's father said he was afraid for them to remain in Guthrie because of his wife's \"bizarre\" behavior that began 18 months ago. That was about the time she began receiving literature from the Samaritan Foundation, he said. He said she began swinging a pendulum over things, including the children, to remove evil. He said she would place a circular drawing under groceries because the foundation's writings said the Universal Price Code, also called a barcode, was evil. She placed the same drawing under the children's pillows, he said.<br>\n\n<br>\nJonathan George said the literature his wife had received was signed with the name Linda Greene. It referred to zombies, vampires and the Antichrist. Much of it was violent in nature, he said. The Oklahoman obtained a copy of the writings, which caution believers not to talk on the telephone because vampires can gain access to them. Another describes President Clinton as \"an animal-mutant zombie,\" first lady Hillary Clinton as \"a three-virtue type zombie\" and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein as a \"five-virtue zombie.\" Jonathan George's attorney, Richard L. Weldon of Chickasha, said Greene claims in her writings that she is Christ because she \"willingly gave her soul so that all of yours could survive. \" Claire Carbone, Jonathan George's sister, said of her sister-in-law: \"That woman is not Nelli. Nelli is a sweet, beautiful mother.

Mary Kett was a friend of hers, a macrobiotic friend who she made a connection with. And I didn’t think too much of it. People get into weird things, and Nelli was always having psychics come over and telling her about past lives and things like that. It's all craziness to me, but it doesn't hurt anything, so when she got involved in this dowsing, I didn't think too much of it. I… I just thought it was just a phase she was going through.

And then she would take all these numbers, and she would put them in these Stars of David, and somehow that was destroying the evil energies of the universe. Or, if we went and bought food and it had a barcode, the barcode was some sort of evil energy that she had to eliminate before she could eat the food. You know, it was weird stuff like that. I thought, okay, it’s weird, it doesn't hurt anything."}]}},{"object":"block","id":"e74e0476-d222-4cfc-b95b-8d58072af721","type":"paragraph","created_time":"2022-05-18T01:26:00Z","last_edited_time":"2022-05-18T01:27:00Z","created_by":{"object":"user","id":"b84e74af-1a0b-495e-ac45-7fa25f54d686","type":"","name":"","avatar_url":"","person":null,"bot":null},"last_edited_by":{"object":"user","id":"b84e74af-1a0b-495e-ac45-7fa25f54d686","type":"","name":"","avatar_url":"","person":null,"bot":null},"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"So she got really into this to the extent where it became like, very, very, very important, and she decided she wanted to go to Oklahoma.
